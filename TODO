A list of things to do for this project:

* Add code to save/load newer Aleph One map formats.
* Fix spelling mistakes visible to the end user.
* Add localization points.
* Make it comply with modern Objective-C practices, including @properties and KVO/KVC.
* There are still some areas where byte-swapping is needed for little-endian CPUs, which modern Macs use.
* The OpenGL preview is borked: Find out why and fix.
* Saving/loading takes awhile: Find out why.
* Scrolling the map around SPIKES RAM usage. Find a better way to draw map.
* Use something more casual-user-friendly to replace PICTs for terminals (and convert to PICT when exporting). 
** Atque might have source code that will help with this, as PICT is heavily deprecated with the rest of QuickDraw.
* Go over obsoleted/Carbon code, salvage what we can, and delete the rest.
* New icons, especially different icons for scenario and map.
* New tool icons, either migrate to template icons or create new hi-res icons based off of existing icons.
* More custom cursor images.
* Migrate away from deprecated UI elements, like NSMatrix, NSDrawer, and NSForm.

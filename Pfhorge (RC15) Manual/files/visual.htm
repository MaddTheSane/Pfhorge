In Forge the visual mode was used for primarily for texturing and some "fine-tuning" reshaping of maps. The viewer's movement was constricted to the map's structure as he would be in the game. In Pfhorge the majority of the texturing is currently done on the map and the Visual Mode is for observation. It's OpenGL-based allowing the viewer to pass unhindered through the walls, zoom in and out, circle around, etc. It does have the drawback at present of everything being "frozen"; liquids don't move, doors don't open, lights don't change, etc. However the presentation of various features can be altered before viewing, e.g., the the extension of platforms, so features and texturing can be checked.

<b>Different Views</b>

The Visual Mode <A HREF="pref-menu.htm">Preferences</A> (Environment) (see below) allows several options for rendering: Wireframe, Flat Colour, Average Colour and Textured. Each requires more memory but provides a better representation of the final map. 
<BR>F1 will toggle between these modes. 
</P><P ALIGN="left">
 F2 toggles ?
<BR>
<BR>F3 toggles landscape.
<BR>
<BR>The Visibility preferences offer a choice of what should or shouldn't be shown. As yet objects still aren't visualised but semi-transparent liquids and grey fog are. 
<BR>F4 will toggle liquids appearance. 
<BR>
<BR>Platforms can be viewed as fully contracted or extended or at quarter intervals between. 
<BR>
<BR>Visible Sides offers the choice of Inwards, Outwards, Both or Show 5D. Normally you would see the textures that face into a room and be unaware of overlapping, 5D space. By chosing "Both" a room is visible inside and out and with "Show 5D" overlapping volumes become apparent. 
<BR>F5 and F6 toggles between each mode. 
<BR>
<BR>The Vertical Look offers the choice between a Marathon representation and a 3rd Generation quality, i.e., perspective. This doesn't affect what is exported to Aleph One. 
<BR>
<BR>Field of View varies between Normal, Extravision and Tunnel (Infravision). 
<BR>F7 will toggle between all three. 
<BR>
<BR>F8 toggles shading.
<BR>
<BR>F9 recenters player on starting point.
<BR>
<BR>F10 toggles fog. 
<BR>
<BR>Lighting can be set at one of several fixed values: active or inactive setting 1 or 2 or an average value.

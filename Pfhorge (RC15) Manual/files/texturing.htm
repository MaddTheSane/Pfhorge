Texturing</FONT></B>
</P>


<BR><P ALIGN="left">
As yet Pfhorge does not allow texturing in the Visual Mode, all texturing having to be done in the 2D map-making through modification of lines (walls) and polygons. 

As noted in <A HREF="Polygons.htm">Polygons</A> a newly constructed polygon has default values including default textures, typically:
<BR>
<BR>	Floor = 0 (0 WU)
<BR>	Ceiling = 1024 (1 WU)
<BR>	Floor Texture = 6
<BR>	Ceiling Texture = 7
<BR>	Floor Light = 0
<BR>	Ceiling Light = 0
<BR>	Liquid Light = 0
<BR>	Whichever Layer is currently selected
<BR>
<BR>These defaults can be altered by selecting a previously modified polygon with the Dropper tool; the defaults will be reset to match the parameters of that polygon. The Dropper can be used by selecting it off the Tool Palette or temporarily by holding down the Option key. 
<BR>
<BR>
The texture of a polygon can be modified by opening the <A HREF="Inspectors.htm">Texture Inspector</A>: which gives a choice of texture set as well individual textures. </p>
<p align="center"><IMG SRC="Texture-polygon.jpg" HEIGHT="236" WIDTH="298" ALIGN=middle BORDER="1"></p>

<p align="left">Drop-down menus allow selection of:<br>
<br>(upper left) texture set
<br>(upper right) offsets
<br>(lower left) textures
<br>(lower right) texture effects
<br><br>
Pfhorge has the advantage of larger texture icons than Forge but currently a marked disadvantage in that they will currently appear as a vertical menu rather than a palette. <br>
<br>
Unlike Forge, the selected textures do not appear on the map, each polygon remaining colour-coded as polygon type.

<p align="left"><b>Wall Texturing</b></p>

<P ALIGN="left">
A wall in Marathon or Aleph One can be either continuous or split into two planes with space between. In Forge the lights and texturing were all added in Visual Mode; here it's mostly done in Normal Mode using the Light and Texture Inspectors. Split walls are labeled as primary (upper), transparent and secondary (lower) surfaces; a solid wall as primary only. 
<BR>
<BR>
Certain default values apply to a new line rather than that of a connecting line as in Forge. The initial defaults are:
<BR>
<BR>Texture = 5
<BR>Light = 0
<BR>Layer = current selection
<BR>
<BR>These defaults can be altered by selecting an altered line with the Dropper tool; the defaults will be reset to match the parameters of that line. The Dropper can be used by selecting it off the Tool Palette or temporarily by holding down the Option key. 
<BR>
<BR>
The <A HREF="Inspectors.htm">Basic Inspector</A> is an extended version of the Solid/Transparent/Empty check-boxes of Forge's Line Parameter editor, adding a Landscape check-box and the ability to deactivate the Auto-set for specific lines. </p>
<p align="center"><IMG SRC="Basic-line.jpg" HEIGHT="269" WIDTH="210" ALIGN=middle BORDER="1">
</p>

<BR><P ALIGN="left">
The <A HREF="Inspectors.htm">Texture Inspector</A> is similar to that for <A HREF="polygons.htm">polygons</A> but has expanded to include a setting for a "transparent" texture, i.e., a texture that visually covers the space between primary and secondary surfaces. When "Use Transparent Texture" is checked a texture set and a specific texture can be selected to appear in that space. Unchecking the box will remove the texture, though the it remains visible but grayed out in the Inspector. In the instance a wall needs texturing on both sides the clockwise/counter-clockwise buttons are used to select the appropriate face.

<p align="left"><b>Control Panels</b></p>
<p align="left">All <A HREF="controls.htm">control panels</A> &amp and <A HREF="terminals.htm">terminals</A> are placed initially as a texture (with offsets) then programmed via the the Control Panel Inspector (see below) by selecting the line in Draw Mode. </p>
<p align="center"><IMG SRC="Control.jpg" HEIGHT="226" WIDTH="205" ALIGN=middle BORDER="1"></p>
<BR>
<p align="left"><b>Lights</b></p>
<p align="left">New <A HREF="lights.htm">lights</A> are initially created and placed in <A HREF="polygons.htm">polygons</A> while texturing floors &amp ceilings. Selecting Light... under the View Menu switches the map to a colour-coded view and opens a drawer with pre-programmed settings. New values can be defined here and applied. For lines/walls the pre-programmed or custom values can be applied through the Light Inspector. </p>

<p align="left"><b>Liquids</b></p>
<p align="left">New <A HREF="liquids.htm">liquids</A> are created and placed only in <A HREF="polygons.htm">polygons</A>. Selecting Liquids... under the View Menu switches the map to a colour-coded view and opens a drawer with pre-programmed settings. New values can be defined here and applied. </p>

<p align="left"><b>Sounds</b></p>
<p align="left">Ambient &amp Random <A HREF="sounds.htm">Sounds</A> can be assigned to <A HREF="polygons.htm">polygons</A> by selecting View Sounds.. under the View Menu or by placing localized sounds from the Tool Palette in Draw Mode. The former acts like Lights and Liquids, opening a drawer for the user to define and place sounds on a colour-coded map while the latter appear as icons in Draw Mode. </p>

<p align="left"><b>Players, Weapons, Aliens &amp Others</b></p>
<p align="left"><A HREF="objects.htm">Objects</A> are placed from the Tool Palette in Draw Mode and appear as icons inside polygons. Each class has a default that can be reset using the Dropper tool. Orientation of each item is determined with the <A HREF="inspectors.htm">Basic Inspector</A>.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Configuration Editor</b></p>
<p align="left">The <A HREF="configuration.htm">Editor</A> is a central monitor for all tags, lights, sounds, liquids, platforms, named polygons &amp; layers within each map.</p><br>

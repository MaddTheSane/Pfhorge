Forge defined Control Panels as textures were added to walls in the Visual Mode. Three different but similar panels would appear depending on which texture was being added. Each had a drop-down menus for control panel type and permutation (what it was linked to) as well as check-boxes that regulated the behaviour of those panels.

In Pfhorge those panels have been combined into one and (at present) a wall is selected as a Control Panel in Normal Mode rather than Visual Mode by selecting the wall and checking the "Side is Control Panel" box in the Control Panel Inspector. 
<BR>
<BR>This activates the drop-down menu shown offering the different types of panel available as well as six check-boxes for modifying the individual properties of each panel. The Permutation menu is active when appropriate, containing the relevant tag numbers/names. 
<BR>
<BR>Pfhorge has also added a "Destructive Switch" available in the Aleph One programming but still remains unclear what this actually does.

<b>General: </b>options to assist in drawing maps and adding objects. When a line is drawn the endpoints will "snap" to the nearest other point or grid cross-section; the sensitivity of this feature can be altered or disabled, as can the guiding algorithms. New objects can also be set to snap to a grid cross-section while invisible layers (see below) can be set to appear as points rather than empty polygons.

<b>Default Layer Settings: </b> Pfhorge is capable of breaking an imported map into vertically separate layers pre-defined by the user. Each layer can be viewed and worked on separately in map-editting. In this preference panel individual layers can be defined and named, the floor &amp; ceiling values entered with sliders or directly in the boxes. Overlap between the layers is OK  as long as the Ceiling Min is greater than the Ceiling Max of the layer below and the the Floor Max less then the Floor Min of the layer above.

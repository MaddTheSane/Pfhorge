A wall in Marathon or Aleph One can be either continuous or split into two planes with space between. In Forge the lights and texturing were all added in Visual Mode; here it's mostly done in Normal Mode using the Light and Texture Inspectors. Split walls are labeled as primary (upper), transparent and secondary (lower) surfaces; a solid wall as primary only.

<BR>
Certain default values apply to a new line rather than that of a connecting line as in Forge. The initial defaults are:
<BR>
<BR>Texture = 5
<BR>Light = 0
<BR>Layer = current selection
<BR>
<BR>These defaults can be altered by selecting an altered line with the Dropper tool; the defaults will be reset to match the parameters of that line. The Dropper can be used by selecting it off the Tool Palette or temporarily by holding down the Option key.

The <A HREF="Inspectors.htm">Basic Inspector</A> is an extended version of the Solid/Transparent/Empty check-boxes of Forge's Line Parameter editor, adding a Landscape check-box and the ability to deactivate the Auto-set for specific lines.

Some walls are assigned as <A HREF="Controls.htm">Control Panels</A> and their exact properties are all controlled through the Control Panel Inspector. The Clockwise/Counter-clockwise buttons enable the selection of the correct line face where the line is the interface between two polygons. All the Control Panel types are available, the permutations being the tag switches pertinent to each type.

The <A HREF="Inspectors.htm">Texture Inspector</A> is similar to that for <A HREF="polygons.htm">polygons</A> but has expanded to include a setting for a "transparent" texture, i.e., a texture that visually covers the space between primary and secondary surfaces. When "Use Transparent Texture" is checked a texture set and a specific texture can be selected to appear in that space. Unchecking the box will remove the texture, though the it remains visible but grayed out in the Inspector. In the instance a wall needs texturing on both sides the clockwise/counter-clockwise buttons are used to select the appropriate face.

<BR><P ALIGN="left">
The <A HREF="Inspectors.htm">Light Inspector</A> is extended in a similar manner; three drop-down menus exist covering primary, secondary &amp; transparent surfaces. Transparent lighting will only be active if there is an active texture.

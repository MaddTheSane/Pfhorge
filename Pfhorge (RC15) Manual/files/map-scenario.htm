This collates a record of all the levels in the same folder and PICTs stored within a subfolder. Alternatively a new scenario file can be created in an empty folder and a Marathon or Aleph One file imported into it; each level will be separated into a new Pfhorge map and the PICT files associated with terminals stored in a subfolder. <BR>If there are files within the folder when the scenario file is created these levels initially will be collated alphabetically; the order can be altered by dragging &amp; dropping and saved. As new levels are created through the scenario file you can determine their order. Levels in imported maps will be loaded in the order they existed in the map. As is explained in <A HREF="Terminals.htm">Terminals</A> the PICT files you need for your terminals should be given their resource numbers for names.</P><p align="center"><IMG SRC="New%20Scenario.jpg" HEIGHT="448" WIDTH="306" ALIGN=middle BORDER="1"></p><P ALIGN="left">A drop-down menu lists the ability to import Marathon, Pathways into Darkness, Physics &amp; Terminal files and Merge the files within the scenario. It is also possible to selectively edit, export and delete individual maps. Rescanning the folder enables the scenario file to update any changes that have been made through files being added or removed within its parent folder. </P><p align="center"><IMG SRC="Scenario%20Options.jpg" HEIGHT="223" WIDTH="268" ALIGN=middle BORDER="1"><BR></p><BR><P ALIGN="left"><b>Creating a New Map</b></P><P ALIGN="left">"New Pfhorge Level" opens a default map window with a drop-down Marathon Settings Sheet. As with Forge a minimum of a Game Type must be entered, but otherwise the name, environment , landscape and mission type can be left as the defaults and altered later. <BR><BR>The exact appearance of the map depends on the colors chosen in General Prefs. The information bar has a drop-down menu for Layers &amp; Options as well Levels for imported map files; it also keeps a running record of the total number of various details incorporated in the map being constructed. Aleph One is not constrained to a maximum of 256 polygons and Pfhorge can handle this. </P><p align="center"><IMG SRC="Info%20bar.jpg" HEIGHT="91" WIDTH="638" ALIGN=middle BORDER="1"></p><BR><P ALIGN="left">The Options drop-down menu enables a short-cut for Aleph One export, a Map Manager Drawer, a Note Group Manager and two diagnostic tools. The Note Group Manager is currently inactive (in future versions it will enable notekeeping for group development of scenarios) while the Map Manager opens a drawer at the side of the window providing quick modification of the editting properties. </P><p align="center"><IMG SRC="Options%20Menu.jpg" HEIGHT="142" WIDTH="244" ALIGN=middle BORDER="1"></p><BR><P ALIGN="left">Preferences can be temporarily over-ridden in the size of the grid, how the points in lines interact with the grid and other points (necessary for fine detail work) and the visibility of objects on the map (necessary for large scale work). <BR><BR>Changing the Selection processes makes it easier to pick out lines, objects or points without accidentally selecting the polygon they're part of. </P><p align="center"><IMG SRC="Selection.jpg" HEIGHT="449" WIDTH="180" ALIGN=middle BORDER="1"><IMG SRC="General.jpg" HEIGHT="504" WIDTH="187" ALIGN=middle BORDER="1"></p><BR><P ALIGN="left">Selecting "Tool Palette" from the Tools Menu opens a floating palette containing all the tools necessary for basic map-making. </P><br><IMG SRC="Tool%20Palette.jpg" HEIGHT="81" WIDTH="224" ALIGN=middle BORDER="1"><br><!--TABLE START--><TABLE>	<TR>		<TD>Select</TD>		<TD>Draw</TD>		<TD>Fill</TD>		<TD>Text</TD>		<TD>Drag</TD>		<TD>Zoom</TD>		<TD>Dropper</TD>	</TR>	<TR>		<TD>Alien</TD>		<TD>Player</TD>		<TD>Weapon</TD>		<TD>Scenery</TD>		<TD>Sound</TD>		<TD>Goal</TD>		<TD>Paintbrush</TD>	</TR></TABLE><!--TABLE END--><BR><BR><P ALIGN="left">This is basically an extended version of that found in Forge. While the Polygon tool has gone, Dropper and Paintbrush tools have been added and the Object tool split into six separate tools for Aliens, Players, etc. The Dropper is similar to that seen in Forge's Visual Mode, identifying the particular properties of a line or polygon and setting them as new defaults. The Paintbrush will apply the collective properties of the defaults (chosen with the Dropper) to a selected line, polygon or object. <BR><BR>If you are using the Zoom In tool then holding down the Option key switches it Zoom Out. With other tools, holding down the Option key temporarily selects the Dropper tool, selecting new default values according to the map element tested. </P><BR><HR SIZE="2" WIDTH="100%"><BR><P ALIGN="center"><FONT SIZE="1"><A HREF="../Contents">Contents | <a href="./introduction.htm">Introduction</a> | <a href="./Pref-Menu.htm">Preferences &amp; Menus</a> | <A HREF="./lines.htm">Lines</A> | <A HREF="./polygons.htm">Polygons</A> | <A HREF="./texturing.htm">Texturing</A> | <A HREF="./lights.htm">Lights</A> | <A HREF="./liquids.htm">Liquids</A> |<br>| <A HREF="./Sounds.htm">Sounds</A> | <A HREF="./controls.htm">Control Panels</A> | <A HREF="./Terminals.htm">Terminals</A> | <A HREF="./objects.htm">Objects</A> | <A HREF="./visual.htm">Visual Mode</A> | <A HREF="./Configuration.htm">Configuration Editor | <A HREF="./Inspectors.htm">Inspectors</A></P></BODY></HTML>

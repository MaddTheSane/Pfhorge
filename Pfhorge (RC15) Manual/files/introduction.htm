The purpose of this manual is to explain the application of Pfhorge to map-making. It assumes the reader has some prior experience of map-making using Forge (or Pfhorte) and highlights the differences between the two. Guides to map-making, both basic and advanced, can be found in the Content Creation section (Map Editting with Forge) at <A HREF="http://source.bungie.org">source.bungie.org</A>, the Aleph One website.
<br>
<BR>
One significant difference between Forge and Pfhorge is the units of measurement. Forge used World Units (WU) for everything while Pfhorge (and Anvil) uses the points of the Marathon/Aleph One programming, 1 WU being 1024 points. A converter can be found at <A HREF="http://source.bungie.org">source.bungie.org</A> in the Content Creation section (Map Editting). Rotation is also measured in a circle of 512&deg;, something masked in Forge by a graphic tool. <br>
<br>
Aleph One has removed some of the limitations placed on Marathon by its programming such as line-of-sight and a maximum number of polygons. Forge can utilize some of these changes but not all. With Pfhorge you can take advantage of these expansions:<br>
</p>

<!--LIST START-->
<UL TYPE="disc">
	<LI>The limits on the number of polygons, platforms and tags per map have been removed.</LI>
	<LI>Names can be given to individual polygons, lights, tags, liquids, etc for easier identification during map-making.</LI>
	<LI>Maps can be divided into layers for the easier construction of overlapping areas.</LI>
	<LI>Textures, landscapes and scenery from different sets can be used in the same map.</LI>
	<LI>Will use any Shapes file as reference.</LI>
	<LI>Incorporation of Marathon 1 "Ouch" &amp; "Glue" polygons.</LI>
	<LI>Operates within the full 64 x 64 x 64 WU cube (max room height 32 WU).</LI>
	<LI>Sounds now potentially 128-fold louder. 
	<LI>Possesses a built-in terminal editor.</LI>
	<LI>Supports scripting and plug-ins.</LI>
	<LI>Scenario compiler.</LI>
	<LI>Open Pathways into Darkness maps.</LI>
</UL>
<!--LIST END-->


<p>
<b>Limitations still exist. </b>
</p>

<!--LIST START-->
<UL TYPE="disc">
	<LI>Most obviously Aleph One has limits and Phorge can't exceed those.</LI>
	<LI>Texturing can't be done in Visual Mode.</LI>
	<LI>Using liquids from different sets in one map hs yet to be implemented.</LI>
	<LI>Aleph One has a 32 WU vertical limit on texturing.</LI>
	<LI>While both Pfhorge and Aleph One support a 64 WU view weapon physics are impractically slow.</LI>
	<LI>While floating polygons are fine there are no bridges or balconies ;-)</LI>
</UL>
<!--LIST END-->

<b>Further Development</b>
</P>
<P ALIGN="left">
Pfhorge is still a work in progress and several features in this manual are described as being inactive or have caveats attached. As a pre-release version the great majority of features are active and reliable and mapmaking is practical. As further versions are released this manual will be updated.

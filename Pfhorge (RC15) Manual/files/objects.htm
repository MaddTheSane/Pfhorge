The advantage is the ability to possess six defaults, the Dropper resetting the defaults only of the tool associated with the object tested. <BR></P><P ALIGN="left"><b>Object Placement</b></P><P ALIGN="left">Activating an object tool and clicking on a filled polygon generates an icon and provides relevant details in the Basic Inspector. The same format is used for all six classes and an individual object can be altered through the two drop-down menus (Object Type and Kind). Clicking on an Object with the Dropper sets the dault for that Object type to those values. <BR><BR>Monsters and Players appear as arrowheads.<BR>Weapons, scenery, sounds &amp; goals appear as small squares. <BR>(Note - these are sounds that occur at specific points rather the Ambient <A HREF="Sounds.htm">Sounds</A> linked to specific <A HREF="Polygons.htm">polygons</A>.)<BR>Colouring depends on the choices made in <A HREF="pref-menu.htm">General Prefs - Colors</A>. <BR><BR>The properties of teleporting in, blindness, deafness and similar are set by the checkboxes. </P><p align="center"><IMG SRC="Basic-alien.jpg" HEIGHT="269" WIDTH="210" ALIGN=middle BORDER="1"></p><BR><P ALIGN="left"><b>Differences from Forge:</b><BR><BR>Similar to textures, each map has access to the complete range of sounds and scenery found in all the texture sets. <BR><BR>The direction of an object is again set as a circle of 512&deg; clockwise but the default is due East rather than the due West of liquids, a vagary of the original Bungie programming. <BR><BR>Height co-ordinates are set in points rather than WU. <BR><BR>When a new object is added it will have the default values not that last values used, i.e., the Weapon tool always reverts to magnum pistol. The defaults are changed with the Dropper tool. </P><BR><P ALIGN="left"><b>Object Placement Editor</b><BR><BR>This is similar to Forge's Set Item/Monster Parameters panels. Starting with the number of that particular object on the map you can specify whether they can be replenished, how often, a minimum and maximum number and a total stock. All monsters and weapons are present on this one panel. The infinite number option that was in Forge is obtainable by setting the "Available" number to 0, contradictory as it sounds. </P><p align="center"><IMG SRC="Object%20Editor.jpg" HEIGHT="375" WIDTH="431" ALIGN=middle BORDER="1"></p><BR><HR SIZE="2" WIDTH="100%"><P ALIGN="center"><FONT SIZE="1"><A HREF="../Contents">Contents | <a href="./introduction.htm">Introduction</a> | <a href="./Pref-Menu.htm">Preferences &amp; Menus</a> | <A HREF="./map-scenario.htm">New Map or Scenario</A> | <A HREF="./lines.htm">Lines</A> | <A HREF="./polygons.htm">Polygons</A> | <A HREF="./texturing.htm">Texturing</A> |<br>| <A HREF="./lights.htm">Lights</A> | <A HREF="./liquids.htm">Liquids</A> | <A HREF="./Sounds.htm">Sounds</A> | <A HREF="./controls.htm">Control Panels</A> | <A HREF="./Terminals.htm">Terminals</A> | <A HREF="./visual.htm">Visual Mode</A> | <A HREF="./Configuration.htm">Configuration Editor | <A HREF="./Inspectors.htm">Inspectors</A></P></BODY></HTML>
